The right bar are recipe buttons, which you can use to select a ruleset.

When you complete a recipe, your forging bonus will be added as a star in the left bar.

When you fill the 4 attempts in the bar, you'll get a medal representing your highest score, and the anvil will lock. Just click a recipe button again to reset the attempt counter and unlock the anvil.

Per-material overworked bonus not implemented yet.

Set the url queryparams (?etcetc after the url path) to set the seed for the target.
